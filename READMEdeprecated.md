# Chrono - The language for powerful backends

Chrono is a language designed to create powerful backends using RAII. This project comes from frustation of languages dependent on heavy runtimes and lack of stable 
and self-suficient standard libraries in a programming language. 

# Inspiration 

Chrono is inspired by a set of languages features: 

- C++ → RAII 
- C# → Great frameworks (EF, ASPNET) 
- Zig → Syntax and solid standard library 
- Go → Clarity 

Combining such language features we basically get **Chrono**. 

# Objective

Chrono's objective is to use RAII for backend and avoid runtime overhead and complex set ups in the development environment, as well for a self-suficient standard
library that is capable of getting the job done without a bloat of features. The point of solving a problem in different ways is not by introducing a thousand 
features, but to think in a thousand ways to solve it using the current setup. 

As for frameworks, they're a extension of the standard library or even chrono itself. What the launguage can't solve or makes it too complex to do it, a framework 
is there to help.
