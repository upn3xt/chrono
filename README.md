# Chrono - General purpose, cross-platform and performance-driven programming language

Chrono is a general purpose programming language that focuses on performance and reproducibility across platforms.


## Memory Model

Chrono uses an RAII-based memory model, ensuring deterministic resource cleanup without garbage collection.

## Inspiration 

Chrono is inspired by a set of languages such as:

- Zig → mainly syntax and you don't have to deal with resource management if you don't want to

- C++ → Memory model and you get to try modern stuff with a better syntax 

- Go → simplicity and doesn't look weird past 100 lines


## Goals

Chrono is being design to be a language capable of: 

- Making powerful software that is cross-platform

- A great development experience 

- Versatility

Basically the coolest language you can imagine.


## Philosophy

Chrono is a language that works with the basic stuff. No need for frameworks, gigantic compiler magic or mega libraries for the average task. It's a language that is meant to be 
self-sufficient to complete a task, making it great for everyday tasks like API's, games, heavy-software and even compilers.

Libraries and frameworks should only be a plus and not a must. Therefore no bloat.

Every software written in chrono should behave the same on every computer. Therefore the cross-platform ability is a must.

The package system should be centered so there's a place where you can download packages and upload them easily. Therefore a united house.

The software you develop in chrono should be cool by inheritance. Therefore you're swaggy and have cool software to show off.
